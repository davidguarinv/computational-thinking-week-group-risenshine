def act1():
    return "Elliot jotted a note about Oliver’s behavior, Tessa insisted even dogs sometimes sensed history, and Marcus laughed so hard he almost dropped his basket again. Jace leaned against the wall, pretending not to care, but Lila caught his curious glance toward the dog. Meanwhile, Oliver, a mischievous stray dog, ran circles around the group, barking at shadows. He seemed to know something about the town, as if he had a secret mission of his own. Lila laughed, deciding he would be their unofficial pet guide."

def act2():
    return "Oliver growled from the corner, Lila pulled Jace closer, Marcus steadied himself again, Elliot kept sketching despite shaking hands, and Tessa shouted instructions no one followed. It was chaos, but all six were caught up in it. Marcus tried to take a closer look but slipped, nearly falling into a hidden pit. Jace grabbed his arm, shouting, “Careful! This place is a death trap!” Tessa scribbled furiously in her papers, trying to make sense of the chaotic scene."

def act3():
    return "Jace shoved a gear into place, Marcus pulled a lever, Lila adjusted the symbols, Tessa read aloud instructions, Elliot twisted bolts, and Oliver barked each time something clicked. They worked as one, all six together at last. Together, the six friends worked quickly, adjusting gears, pulling levers, and aligning strange inscriptions. Sweat dripped down their faces as the clocktower seemed to come alive. Jace, surprisingly, whispered, “Okay… this is actually kinda cool.”"
