    return "All six gathered at the town’s edge that morning: Lila, eager and wide-eyed, Jace, already skeptical, Marcus with his flour-dusted hands, Tessa with her notes, Elliot scribbling nervously from a corner, and Oliver circling at their feet. Each seemed to carry a piece of the mystery without knowing it. Lila, a curios teen, steped into the old town for the frist time, her eyes wide with wondr. She had herd storis of the clocktower that never tolled on tiem. Beside her, her brother Jace was allreddy skeptical, muttering about wasted time."

def act2():
    return "Lila led the way up, Jace complaining as usual, Marcus grumbling about his knees, Tessa taking furious notes, Elliot muttering about gears, and Oliver darting ahead, nails clicking on the old wood. Together, the six sounded like an army of mismatched explorers. Inside the tower, the wooden stairs creaked under thier weight, each step echoeing through the emptie halls. Lila’s flashlight flickered, casting spooky shaps on the walls. Marcus mumbled about old hauntings, making Jace scff loudly."

def act3():
    return "The six crowded onto the balcony: Lila clutching her notebook, Jace scowling, Marcus steadying Oliver, Tessa muttering theories, and Elliot nearly dropping his book in awe. The view tied them together in uneasy silence. Back on the tower’s balcomy, the town stretched out below them, lights twinkeling like stars. Lila realized the clocktower wasn’t just a building; it was a gaurdian of hidden knowlege. Jace grumbled, “All I see is a high plase to get blown off."
