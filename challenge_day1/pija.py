def act1():
    return "Lila, a curious teen, stepped into the old town for the first time, her eyes wide with wonder. She had heard stories of the clocktower that never tolled on time. Beside her, her brother Jace was already skeptical, muttering about wasted time."

def act2():
    return "Inside the tower, the wooden stairs creaked under their weight, each step echoing through the empty halls. Lila’s flashlight flickered, casting spooky shapes on the walls. Marcus mumbled about old hauntings, making Jace scuff loudly."

def act3():
    return "Back on the tower’s balcony, the town stretched out below them, lights twinkling like stars. Lila realized the clocktower wasn’t just a building; it was a guardian of hidden knowledge. Jace grumbled, “All I see is a high place to get blown off.”"
