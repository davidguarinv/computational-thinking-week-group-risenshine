    return "Marcus nudged Tessa, while Elliot pretended to focus on his notes, though he was really watching Lila and Jace argue. Oliver barked and nearly knocked over Marcus’s basket of bread, making everyone laugh for a moment before turning back toward the tower. Marcus, the local shopkeeper, waved at them from across the streat. “Ye’ll need a guid if ye want to find the tower!” he shouted, spillng some of his fresh baked breads. Lila nodded excitedly, her notebook ready to scrible down every detale."

    return "Marcus leaned in with curiosity, Jace pointed out how useless scribbles were, Oliver sniffed the stones, and Elliot tried to sketch the carvings in his notebook. The group crowded around Tessa as she lectured, and Lila quietly traced the symbols with her finger. Tessa pointed out a serie of strange symbols carved into the stone walls. “These are older then the town itself,” she said, brushing away dust. Lila’s heart raced as she tried to decifer them, feeling like they held a key to somthing bigger."

    return "Tessa carefully picked up one of the manuscripts, brushing off the dust. “It speeks of a timekeeper… someone who can control the flow of hours,” she whispered. Marcus scratched his head, muttering about how he prefered baking to time travell."
