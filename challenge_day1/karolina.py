    return "Marcus nudged Tessa, while Elliot pretended to focus on his notes, though he was really watching Lila and Jace argue. Oliver barked and nearly knocked over Marcus’s basket of bread, making everyone laugh for a moment before turning back toward the tower. Marcus, the local shopkeeper, waved at them from across the street. “Ye’ll need a guide if ye want to find the tower!” he shouted, spilling some of his fresh baked breads. Lila nodded excitedly, her notebook ready to scribble down every detail."

def act2():
    return "Tessa pointed out a series of strange symbols carved into the stone walls. “These are older than the town itself,” she said, brushing away dust. Lila’s heart raced as she tried to decipher them, feeling like they held a key to something bigger."

def act3():
    return "Tessa carefully picked up one of the manuscripts, brushing off the dust. “It speaks of a timekeeper, someone who can control the flow of hours,” she whispered. Marcus scratched his head, muttering about how he preferred baking to time travel."
