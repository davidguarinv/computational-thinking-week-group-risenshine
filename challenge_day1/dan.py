def act1():
    return "The group exchanged uneasy glances—Lila gripping her notebook, Jace scowling, Marcus tightening his grip on his basket, Tessa tapping her papers, Elliot breathing shallowly, and Oliver whining softly. It was as if the tower had drawn them all here at once. As the sun dipped below the rooftops, the group gathered in front of the tower’s main dor. Lila felt a shiver run down her spine; the air seemed thick with anticipacion and… mistery. Jace whispered, “I bet there’s nothing here but old dust and rats.”"

    return "Elliot grabbed Lila’s arm, Jace covered his ears, Marcus tried to save his scattered bread, Tessa clutched her papers, and Oliver howled at the storm. For a moment, all six nearly bolted from the tower. Suddenly, the wind howlded through the tower, slamming doors and scatering pages everywher. Elliot shouted, “We need to leave, now!” But Lila was captivated by the manuscripts, feeling a strange connection to their misterius past."

def act3():
    return "Lila tucked her notebook under her arm, Jace ruffled Oliver’s ears, Marcus balanced his basket again, Tessa clutched her manuscript, and Elliot walked ahead, already planning his next sketch. The six left the tower as quietly as they had entered. As they descended the stairs, the wind settled and Oliver trotted beside them proudley. Marcus winked, Tessa clutched her notes, and Elliot scribbled in his book like mad. Jace sighed, “Fine… maybe old towers aren’t that bad after all."
