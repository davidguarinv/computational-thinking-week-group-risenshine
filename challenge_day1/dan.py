def act1():
    return "The group exchanged uneasy glances—Lila gripping her notebook, Jace scowling, Marcus tightening his grip on his basket, Tessa tapping her papers, Elliot breathing shallowly, and Oliver whining softly. It was as if the tower had drawn them all here at once. As the sun dipped below the rooftops, the group gathered in front of the tower’s main door. Lila felt a shiver run down her spine; the air seemed thick with anticipation and… mystery. Jace whispered, “I bet there's nothing here but old dust and rats."

def act2():
    return "Suddnely, the wind howlded through the tower, slamming doors and scattering pages everywhere. Elliot shouted, “We need to leave, now!” But Lila was captivated by the manuscripts, feeling a strange connection to their mysterius past."

def act3():
    return "As they descended the stairs, the wind settled and Oliver trotted beside them proudly. Marcus winked, Tessa clutched her notes, and Elliot scribbled in his book like mad. Jace sighed, “Fine… maybe old towers aren't that bad after all."
